#+title: implement zettelkasten ids with org roam

each note in [[file:20210511183946-zettelkasten.org][zettelkasten]] has a unique id that does not imply any organization. a good method is to use a ISOSEC timestamp that is unique up to the second.

to implement unique file that represent the id of a note, you just change the org-roam-capture-template with UTC datetime and remove the title from the file name
