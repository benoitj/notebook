#+title: handling money in programming

* Money as an object

money is not just a BigDecimal, it associate a value, with currency.

It brings these properties:
- default rounding usually based on the lowest currency unit
- math on money of different currency requires conversion
- gets properties of currency, like ISO code, symbol, and separator.

See Martin Fowler's [[https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/money.html][P of EAA: Money]]

* Currency

related to money is currency.

Currency represent a unit/kind of money. it affect rounding, string representation, conversion.

See Martin Fowler's [[https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CurrencyAsValue.html][CurrencyAsValue]]

* Double vs Bigdecimal

Double / float in java is base 2 so it has rounding error.

for example 0.7 + 0.1 would give 0.79999999 instead of 0.8

For this reason, we use BigDecimal as an underlying value for money
