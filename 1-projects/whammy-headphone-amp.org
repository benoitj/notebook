* Description

*THE WHAMMY CLASS-A HEADPHONE AMPLIFIER*

Wayne Colburn, the genius at Pass Labs who for the last 25 years has designed essentially all the things that aren't speaker amplifiers, wanted to make a fun, high-performance, fantastic-sounding, Class-A, DIY headphone amp for this community. We call it:

Wayne's Headphone Amp Must Make Yourself

Yes, it's a silly name. But it's cute. And it explains a lot about it. So it stuck.

Given the explosion in the popularity of headphones, as well as the unbelievable amount of choice and variety in the market, it seemed that a simple and great-sounding headphone amp would be a great addition to the DIY community.

Because there are so many choices of headphones, from Planars to IEM's, high impedance or low, this amp will drive any headphone you want to throw at it (Well, not electrostatic headphones directly, no amp like this will, but it will happily drive a step-up transformer like Stax).

Wayne wanted a universal headphone amp for his desk. This is the fruit of that idea. *It's made to be made in an afternoon or an evening and it has no builder adjustments, so it’s going to have a high likelihood of success and completion for beginners and experienced DIYers. :-)*

It's an all in one PCB, just wire the AC & fuse, input and output jacks. Add a selector switch if you like.

Class-A output stage with enough current to drive anything. It also makes a wonderful line stage with about 14db of gain.

* YOUR CHOICE - PCB OR PCB PLUS PARTS KIT

We are now selling both the a WHAMMY PCB by itself, as well as a parts kit that includes the PCB, and everything else you need to build the WHAMMY other than a chassis.

- We are working on a chassis for the future and will definitely release one, but we aren't going to rush it
- 6L6 has done a great WHAMMY build guide and the supplied parts will match the build guide, more or less
- We have now seen multiple successful builds of this new kit, and are now opening pre-orders for the kit, shipping January 11th 2019

** PCB DETAILS

- 218mm x 160mm (8 5/8" x 6 5/16")
- Black with gold immersion traces
- 70oz Copper

** KIT DETAILS
The kit includes everything to make the amp except the PCB and chassis. All components are of the highest quality.

- Dale RN55 milspec resistors
- Panasonic FC & FR series capacitors
- Elna SILMIC II capacitors
- Solid aluminum anodized volume knob
- Alps "Blue Velvet" potentiometer
- Neutrik RCA connectors
- Schurter filtered power entry module with spare fuse
- TRS Headphone Jack
- IRF610/9610 Power MOSFETs
- Texas Instruments RC4580 op amp
- Teflon insulated silver plated copper milspec wire for I/O connections
- Silver bearing eutectic Kester 44 solder for I/O connections
- All nuts, bolts and standoffs to attach external connectors and the PCB to a chassis

* ILLUSTRATED BUILD GUIDE
Most of the info you need to complete this project can be found in the first 6 posts this thread, a well-illustrated guide showing how everything goes together.

Here's a rough (but useful) list with some important annotations.

Most part numbers are from Mouser.com (unless they end with "-ND", and then it's Digikey.com)

(6)220UF/50V C3 C4 C8 C9 C10 C28 220UF/50V 647-UKZ1E221MHM 50v parts were specified as there are a million of them at Pass Labs. You can use 25v capacitors with no disadvantages. A lower-voltage capacitor might also be physically smaller, and that would be good, as there's not much room around the opamp socket. Also using a smaller value capacitor (around 10-100uF) in these positions will be fine as the PSU is so incredibly clean by the time it makes it to these caps...

1/4W (or bigger) resistors

Note - The part numbers shown are for the Vishay/Dale RN55D series, a mil-spec resistor with non-magnetic leads, non-RoHS, and 100% thermal derating. Which is to say it's a 1/4W resistor that says 1/8W on the box. And has tinned copper leads. Because they are non-RoHS (I.E., not lead-free) they are cheaper. (And honestly better. Look up "tin whiskers")
They are of fantastic precision, sound great, and the value is written clearly on the body of the resistor. They are far and wide my favorite resistor.
