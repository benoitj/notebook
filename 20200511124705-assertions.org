* TODO assertj
Fluent assertion library

assertion uses equals / hashcode methods to assert, but uses toString to render assertion errors.

This offers nice diff in IDEs

* TODO enhancements

** better string representations

its possible to override the string representation of objects.



* alternatives - hamcrest

really popular alternative is hamcrest (larger userbase)

quite similar to assertj with extensive list of assertions, at the same time different as it follows junit assertions instead of being fluent.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
assertThat(something, isEquals(anotherThing));
#+END_SRC

does not provide fluent assertions
