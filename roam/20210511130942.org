#+title: health probes and status probes for spring boot
#+roam_tags: java

* problem

we often need to know if our app is working:
1. if we can connect to the database
2. if everything is ready to serve requests
3. some metrics of the app like:
   1. build information
   2. configuration information

* Spring actuators

spring actuators implement health probes with just few lines of code

** maven setup

add this dependency:
#+begin_src xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
#+end_src

** setup a port

set a port and limit access to localhost

within the application.properties:

#+begin_src config
management.server.port=9001
management.server.address=127.0.0.1
#+end_src
