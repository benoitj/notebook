#+title: SMART Criteria

Each objective should be:
 - Specific – target a specific area for improvement.
 - Measurable – quantify or at least suggest an indicator of progress.
 - Assignable – specify who will do it.
 - Realistic – state what results can realistically be achieved, given available resources.
 - Time-related – specify when the result(s) can be achieved.
