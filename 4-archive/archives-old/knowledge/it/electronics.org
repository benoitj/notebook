#+TITLE: Electronics

* IOT
** boards
*** ESP32 and ESP8266
- wemos board are easy to play (D1 mini, D1) we use mostly the D1 mini for now
- $: around 2-3$ for esp8266, 7-10$ for esp32
*** AVR cpu
- arduino boards and clones: nano, uno, mega. We do most of the initial work on nano
- $: similar price range than ESPs
*** pic based boards
- AVR and PIC are owned by the same company. they offer different characteristics. we have not tried the PIC yet.
*** stm32
- much more powerful than the other ones listed. 32 bit cpu (compare to 8 or 16 for the others)
- not yet tried these
- similar price range
*** pc104
- many embedded controls are pc104. 
- not so much for IoT. they are expensive
** platform (in order)
*** arduino
- good abstraction layer to most cpu listed above (except pc104 based boards)
- binary larger than native sdks
- large community: ++ documentation ++ youtube videos ++ FOSS libraries
- fast to do POC
- c, c++
- I would stick to this platform to start with
*** native sdk
- I myself started on esp8266 native sdk.
  - Take some time to compile and install the tool chain
  - make sense to optimize but longer to develop with than arduino
- a better fit to reduce production cost by reducing resource usage
- usually c, c++
*** lua nodeMCU
- interpreter
- lua language (similar to nodejs)
- faster development cycle
- user base?
*** uPython
- pretty new
- does not seems to have a large user base
- some CPUs may not run this properly for larger applications (memory management issues)
** tools
*** IDE
**** arduino IDE
- easy to start. 
- quite limited for "professional" work. 
- could serve the first few sessions, but expect to leave it not long after
- large hobbyist community
**** platformio
- based on atom IDE
- professional grade
- paid version supports unit test and debugging
- supports many boards/cpu, platform
- large user base
- this is the IDE we use now since 2-3 weeks
**** sloeber
- eclipse based
- FOSS
- some ways to unit test, mock your hardware and also supports debugging
- pretty new and small user base
- I started playing with it and it is promizing. Could be a cheaper alternative to platformio for unit test and debugging.
- we plan to try it once we are stable on platformio
**** VS Code
- we plan to try it once we are stable on sloeber
**** CLion
- we plan to try it once we are stable on VS Code
*** ci
any should work well with platformio
if you want to run automated tests, you may need to run your own server with devices connected to it
**** travis
**** jenkins
*** testing
**** platformio
**** sloeber
not sure for others
*** debugging (board dependant)
**** platformio
**** sloeber
**** atmel studio
** communication
*** wifi
ESP8266, ESP32 (also has bluetooth)
*** RF
- NRF24L01 (really cheap ~1$, and low power)
- there are more boards, but I'm not familiar with them
*** LoRa (Low power, Long range)
- frequency is dependant of your location (3 ranges, asia, europe, america)
- really long range. could be up to 30-40km and maybe even more
- some paid network and some community/free networks (see https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/)
- Andrea Spiess has many good information about lora: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCu7_D0o48KbfhpEohoP7YSQ
- 2x expensive than regular RF ~3$ (for the SX1278), and much more if you need to build a gateway (15$ for the emmiter + a raspberry pi)
- I have'nt tried yet, but is on the list. I would have to build a gateway if I use at my place. There is one free gateway in downtown montreal though
** sensors 
- you can buy any kit pretty cheap
- things like: https://www.ebay.ca/itm/37-Sensors-Assortment-Kit-37-in-1-Sensor-Module-Starter-Kit-for-Arduino-MCU/132103269930?hash=item1ec1f7ee2a:g:-WIAAOSw4CFYrD1Y
- GPS modules are a bit more expensive  https://www.ebay.ca/itm/Ublox-NEO-6M-GPS-Module-Aircraft-Flight-Controller-For-Arduino-MWC-IMU-APM2/253247982818?hash=item3af6c18ce2:g:fZcAAOSwstxVH4WP
** standards
https://iot.eclipse.org/standards/
- so far we used: REST and MQTT
