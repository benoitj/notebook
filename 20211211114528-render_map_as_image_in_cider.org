#+title: render map as image in cider
 sent on #clojure chat
11:01  selfsymmetric-mu | Hey, if anyone wants to debug their Advent of Code solutions today by rendering their octopus map as an image, I've cooked up some rendering code for that: https://pastie.io/raw/bchmqo
11:01  selfsymmetric-mu | In Emacs, if you `(setq cider-repl-use-pretty-printing nil)` and `(setq cider-repl-use-content-types t)`, then calling `(render example)` will show the map as an image in your REPL.
