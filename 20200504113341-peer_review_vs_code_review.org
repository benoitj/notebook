[[file:20200228101727_programming.org][R:programming]] [[file:20200504114445-dev_practices.org][R:dev practices]]

* Code review

Review code. usually a after implementation activity organized around pull requests

* Peer review

peer review starts before even coding:
1. story kickoff
2. collective design / implementation approach
3. ongoing reviews to discuss findings, adjust, confirm next steps

Usually by the time the story is completed and the PR is opened, the PR is mostly a formality.




* benefits

** Quality

The implementation mindset with quality in mind.
There are no after implementation back and forth on getting the story completed and no rush to close it (ie: less shortcuts)

** Knowledge sharing

approach are shared, implementation tricks discussed

** Training

people are not left alone, pairing is easily triggered using this model
